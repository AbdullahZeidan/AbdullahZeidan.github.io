When stepping into the world of frontend web development, It's easy to get into the habit of using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc..., to give your text a font size. There are other examples for that too.

## Cases where it's okay to rely on the tags for styling

There are several HTML elements that serve a good semantic meaning for their corresponding style. The easiest example (that you'll most likely never screw up) are the superscript (`<sub>`) and subscript (`<sup>`) tags.

Their semantic element gives them the visual meaning immediately. They are **supposed** to be used for presenting text as subscripts and superscripts (looking at you, using plain `<span>` elements for doing subscript styles!), which act as subtext descriptive to the text connected to it.

Another good and common example is the the (`<strike>`) for striking through text. Here, we'll also notice visuals match semantic meaning; you'll usually reach out and grab this element for decorating text with a ~strikethrough~ to indicate its ~outdated-ness~ irrelevance.

## Cases where you shouldn't rely on tags for styling

There are multiple different sets of HTML elements that are used wrong. We're going to introduce the most common mistake first, and that's headings.

### Headings (`<h1>` → `<h6>`)

The most common mistake I see is relying on heading tags ‒ `<h1>` through `<h6>` ‒ for styling. It's easy to get into the habit of doing that, since most web browsers' default stylesheet do give the `h` tags font sizes from the largest to smallest. This causes us to naturally reach for the tag based on its font size to match a specific design.

Visually, this would seem fine, but it comes at the cost of accessibility and HTML semantics.

One of the crucial rules of web accessibility is that each page must have **one and only one `<h1>` element** on any given page; meaning, never _more than one_ and never _zero_ `<h1>` elements.

Typically, the `<h1>` would be for the main heading of your page, usually within the page's hero section.

### NEVER skip a heading level

> Do not skip heading levels: always start from `<h1>`, followed by `<h2>` and so on.

The above is quoted from [MDN's page on heading tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#nesting). This is another very important rule. The rule indicates that that you should **always** start with an `<h1>`. Then, when you start to have more headings, use `<h2>` elements after that. Then, if there are other headings that are lower level than `<h2>` elements, start using `<h3>` elements for those, and so on...

So, you let the document's semantic hierarchy decide your use of `h` tags and follow that with your own styling for each, not the other way around ‒ where you choose the `h` tag for the styles, then choose its role in the document based on its size.

In fact, there might be some rare cases where you might want to use smaller font sizes for higher level headings. Let's take [Tailwind's](https://tailwindcss.com) landing page as an example.

Here, the smaller text at the top ‒ if we ignore the font sizes ‒ sounds like the title of the section, _more so_ than the larger text in the middle. Many people naturally will use `<h2>` for the larger text and an `<h3>` or `<p>` for the smaller text at the top.
