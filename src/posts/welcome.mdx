## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

It looks like you're interested enough to take a look at my very first blog post. I would like to begin with welcoming you to the inception of my blog!

Second, I would like to say thank you! Thank you for showing interest in my blog during its beginning. It all comes down to you enjoying and benefiting from the posts that I'll be making in the end, Insha'allah. ðŸ¤²

## The Motive Behind This Blog

I want this place to be a platform for me to share what I've learned with the world - and what I will be learning throughout my career Insha'allah. I want others to benefit, progress, and grow just like I did. It may also become a place to allow the sharing of ideas with you so that we can both learn from each other.

## What Kind of Content To Expect

Content will mostly come down to what I'm currently most interested in when it comes to topics. Since I'm mainly a frontend developer, you'll likely often see me post about web development, with technologies like React, TypeScript, CSS (likely a lot of Tailwind), accessibility, and more. it'll be fun, I promise.

Thank you again for showing interest in this project. Hope to see you on my next post. ðŸ¤—
